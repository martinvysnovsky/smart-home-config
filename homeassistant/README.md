## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martinvysnovsky/smart-home-config.git
cd smart-home-config/homeassistant
```

2. **Copy the configuration files** to your Home Assistant configuration directory, typically located at `/config`:

```bash
cp -r configuration/* /config
```

Alternatively you can create symlinks to the configuration files. This way your configuration will always be up-to-date.

```bash
cd /homeassistant
ln -s smart-home-config/homeassistant/configuration/configuration.yaml configuration.yaml
```

NOTE: you need to clone the repository inside `/homeassistant` folder.

3. **Install custom components** (if any) by copying them to the appropriate directory within your Home Assistant setup.

4. **Restart Home Assistant** to apply the new configurations:

```bash
docker restart homeassistant  # If using Docker
```

## Usage

- Edit `configuration.yaml` to configure integrations and services.
- Update `automations.yaml` to add or modify automation rules.
- Customize the frontend using files in the `themes/` and `www/` directories.

## Automation Examples

Here are a few examples of automation rules included in this repository:

### Turn on lights at sunset

```yaml
- alias: "Turn on living room lights at sunset"
  trigger:
    platform: sun
    event: sunset
  action:
    service: light.turn_on
    entity_id: light.living_room
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the configuration files to suit your needs. Add new automations, scripts, and custom components as needed.
